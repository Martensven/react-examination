            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p className="about-p">My name is MÃ¥rten, a 31 year old student currently studying to be a Front End Developer, which i will be right before the summer of 2026.
                <br /><br />
                At a high school level i studied IT, so im a bit of a jack of all trades when it comes to computers.
                <br /><br />
                Throughout my working life i've worked in call center setting. At first as first line support for one of swedens biggest ISPs, then later for a professional switchboard service company, Responda.
                <br /><br />
                At Responda, I worked as a project manager, which meant i was in charge of onboarding new clients and setting up our services for their needs. I was the bridge between our clients and our agents, making sure all the cogs of the machine fit together just right.
